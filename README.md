Project Code
The webpage can be accessed at http://www.redootv.com , and my project code is located at
https://github.com/jried31/google-maps-uber-data. The project code can be run by downloading from Github, and within the project folder run “node server.js”.

Dataset
From https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data . I was specifically told to focus on the files uber-raw-data-<month>14.csv, which track anonymized pickup locations for drivers in NYC.

For this project, I was instructed to transform the data such that half of the data become pickup
locations, and the other half drop off. Then develop a website that displays information about
the dataset.
